# ðŸ“˜ today-i-learned

A collection of small things I learn day to day across a variety of topics. This repository serves as a digital notebook to keep track of everything I discover and understand better as I continue learning.

## ðŸ“‚ **Structure**
The repository is organized by categories. Each category contains markdown files for individual topics learned.
